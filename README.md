<h2>Description</h2>

This project is the fourth class of <i>Jornada Python</i> from <i>Hashtag Treinamentos</i> and it 
consists in live chat made with Flet, a Python web framework, and SocketIO. The application have a login button,
a pop-up window in which the users put their names and a field to send messages. With SocketIO, all the users logged in the chat will receive the messages. The application doesn't have a database to store the messages,
so just before users are logged in, they can see the messages.
